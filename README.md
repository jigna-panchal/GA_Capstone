__General Assembly Capstone Project: Predicting Character Based on Dialogue__

The Capstone Project was divided into 6 parts, each building on top of skills learned previously to scaffold our learning over the entire course. Project deliverables included objectives, requirements, and suggested resources - all of which tie into the overall competencies for this course.

  __*Capstone, Part 1: Data Acquisition*__   
  Using webscraping skills learned in the course and other tools, as necessary, source and collect relevant data.    
  Requirements: Source and describe the data for my project.    
  Format: Pandas DataFrame with relevant description in a Jupyter Notebook.

  __*Capstone, Part 2: Data Cleaning*__   
  Data transformation and cleaning are extremely necessary when working with an unknown dataset. It is an intergral step of the data science workflow!    
  Requirements: Perform preliminary data munging and cleaning of the data relevant to the project goals. Format and save the data in an easy to way for next steps.     
  Format: Pandas DataFrame with relevant description in a Jupyter Notebook.

  __*Capstone, Part 3: EDA + Preliminary Analysis*__   
  Once cleaned, start to quantitatively describe and visualize the data. While you can perform, what seems like, an endless amount of EDA, it is important to obtain meaningful insights in relation to the goals of the project. During EDA, describe your approach, results, setbacks, and findings.   
  Requirements: Perform initial descriptive and visual analysis of the data. Identify outliers, summarize risks and limitations, and describe how the EDA will inform modeling decisions.   
  Format: Jupyter Notebook

  __*Capstone, Part 4: Modeling*__   
  Using various machine learning techniques, find the best model for your dataset. Describe any preprocessing performed, feature engineering, hyperparameters, and other models that were tested to help you find the best model for your data.    
  Requirements: Evaluate model performance and discuss results.     
  Format: Jupyter Notebook

  __*Capstone, Part 5: Findings + Technical Report*__   
  Share the technical findings and an overall summary of the project with your fellow data scientists. Explain your goals, describe modeling choices, evaluate model performance, and discuss results. The overview should be technical, but, also, tell a compelling story.   
  Requirements: Summarize your goals and metrics for success, variables of interest, and removal of any outliers or data imputation. The process description should be concise and relevant to the goals. Summarize statistical analysis, including model selection, implementation, evaluation, and inference. Clearly label plots and visualizations.    
  Format: Jupyter Notebook

  __*Capstone, Part 6: Presentation*__   
  Based on the findings put together a presentation that delivers the most important insights from the project. Tell the most interesting story about the data. Break down the process for a novice audience.    
  Requirements: Convey your goals, limits/assumptions, methods and their justification, findings, and conclusions. Include graphics and visualizations.   
  Format: Slide deck and/or website

  __*Capstone, Part 7: Bonus*__   
  If there are any next steps that were started on, add them in here.
